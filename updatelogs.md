# update logs for software work!!

## 2/3/2026:
- made database w/ python django

## 2/5/2025

to do : build out HTML template (map part of the website. doesn't need to be accurate at this point. maybe make just 3 spots.) 

this HTML part will then be added into the django backend part.

j look up django and html and similar stuff

for alpha prototype, youtube link for how to make a basic grid on html: https://www.kirupa.com/css/creating_3x3_grid.htm

we can also use this for the alpha prototype, this is a simpler html: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp

how to put an html website online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QU3kLFPdg

what we need to do
- frontend html page ; connected to the parking spots state changes
- make basic html grid (doesnt need to be accurate to babbio garage yet, this is alpha prototype)
- tie the backend state changes to the frontend visual updates (to test we can push updates manually on the backend, no hardware needed yet)
- when hardware is testable, tie the backend to the arduino code (research how to do this, direct collab w/ hardware for this)
