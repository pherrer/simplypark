# update logs for software work!!

## 2/3/2026:
- made database w/ python django

what we need to do
- frontend html page ; connected to the parking spots state changes
- make basic html grid (doesnt need to be accurate to babbio garage yet, this is alpha prototype)
- tie the backend state changes to the frontend visual updates (to test we can push updates manually on the backend, no hardware needed yet)
- when hardware is testable, tie the backend to the arduino code (research how to do this, direct collab w/ hardware for this)
